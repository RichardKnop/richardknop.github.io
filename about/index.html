  <h1>About me</h1>
  
  <p>Experienced system engineer and a generalist who likes to write clean well-tested code and designing scalable platforms and applications.</p>

  <p>I have a lot of experience in architecture, having designed and developed API platforms for several startups that allowed them to quickly get to market and grow.</p>

  <p>I prefer working with modern technologies - currently using Go as my main programming language to develop microservices designed to be run as Docker containers on CoreOS.</p>

  <p>Having strong dev ops skills, I use Terraform to build and manage IaaS infrastructure (mainly AWS, but also have experience with Google Cloud, Azure and bare metal) and Ansible to configure servers.</p>

  <p>Other than that, I am very keen on testing, continuous integration and best practices and I am a frequent contributor to open source software.</p>
