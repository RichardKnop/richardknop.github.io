  <h1>About me</h1>
  
  <p>Experienced distributed systems engineer, architect, open source contributor, Gopher and Pythonista with just enough JavaScript/CSS/HTML knowledge.</p>

  <p>Having designed and developed greenfield API platforms for several startups that allowed them to quickly get to market and become leaders in their fields, I have gained valuable technical skills and significant experience.</p>

  <p>I focus on using modern open source technology and keeping in sync with latest industry practices. Currently I use Go as my main programming language and heavily utilise modern dev ops tools such as Docker, etcd, Kubernetes and CoreOS.</p>

  <p>I prefer having a fully automated and easily reproducible environments. Having used tools such as Terraform, Ansible and Puppet to automate provisioning of environments on cloud providers such as AWS I feel confident switching from programming to more dev ops focused roles.</p>

  <p>Other than that, I am very keen on testing, continuous integration and best practices and I am a frequent contributor to open source software.</p>
