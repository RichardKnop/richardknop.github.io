  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I am an experienced software engineer and a generalist who likes to write clean well-tested code and designing scalable platforms and applications.</p>
  <p>I prefer working on microservices architectures built with modern technologies. My favourite weapons of choice are Go (Python coming in a close second) and Postgres.</p>
  <p>My expertise is not just limited to writing software and includes strong DevOps and architecture skills. I prefer to use Terraform to build an AWS infrastructure, Ansible to configure it and deploy my microservices using Docker and CoreOS with configuration stored in etcd.</p>
  <p>Other than that, I have experience with full SDLC and am very keen on testing, continuous integration and best practices and I am a frequent contributor to open source software.</p>
