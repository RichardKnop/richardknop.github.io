  <h1>About me</h1>
  
  <p>I'm an experienced distributed systems engineer, open source contributor, Gopher and Pythonista I have mostly focused on backend programming in Go & Python, dev ops and automation (AWS, Terraform, Ansible, docker, kubernetes).</p>
  
  <p>HMy experience ranges from being first or one of first engineers at small startups, through working for large enterprise corporations and government agencies, to working for hyper growth startup unicorns with massive scale.</p>
  
  <p>Check out my flagship open source project Machinery (long story short - celery for golang). Also see my github profile for my other contributions.</p>
  
  <p>I prefer having a fully automated and easily reproducible environments. Having used tools such as Terraform, Ansible and Puppet to automate provisioning of environments on cloud providers such as AWS I feel confident switching from programming to more dev ops focused roles.</p>
