  <h1>About me</h1>
  
  <p>Experienced distributed systems engineer, architect, open source contributor, Gopher and Pythonista. A generalist experienced in designing scalable platforms and applications and writing clean well-tested code.</p>

  <p>Having designed and developed greenfield API platforms for several startups that allowed them to quickly get to market and become leaders in their fields, I have gained valuable technical skills and significant experience.</p>

  <p>I focus on using modern open source technology and latest dev ops industry trends. Currently I use Go as my main programming language and design small decoupled components which I deploy as Docker containers on CoreOS hosts either on IaaS cloud provider (AWS, GC or Azure) or bare metal.</p>

  <p>This approach is referred to as microservices and offers several benefits to organisations. I prefer having a fully automated and easily reproducible environments. I use Terraform and Ansible to achieve this goal.</p>

  <p>Other than that, I am very keen on testing, continuous integration and best practices and I am a frequent contributor to open source software.</p>
