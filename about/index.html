  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I am a generalist experienced in creation of scalable platforms and applications. I have been working on micro services, SOAs, mobile and web apps, video transcoding.</p>
  <p>I prefer composition over inheritance, SOA over monolithic systems (micro services). I like to remove inefficiencies, automate manual tasks and to think of ways to simplify complex processes.</p>
  <p>My favourite language is Python followed by Go and JavaScript. For server configuration I like to use Puppet or Ansible, RabbitMQ is message queue of choice.</p>
  <p>I used other languages as well (Objective C, PHP), many frameworks (e.g. Django, Backbone) and both relational and NoSQL databases (Postgres, MySQL, Elasticsearch, DynamoDB, Cassandra, Redis).</p>
