  <h1>About me</h1>
  <p>I am a generalist experienced in creation of scalable platforms and applications. I have been working on micro services, PaaS, mobile and web applications, video transcoding.</p>
  <p>I prefer composition over inheritance, SOA over monolithic systems (micro services). I like to remove inefficiencies, automate manual tasks and to think of ways to simplify complex processes.</p>
  <p>My favourite language is Go followed by Python and JavaScript. For server configuration I like to use Ansible or Puppet, RabbitMQ is message queue of choice.</p>
  <p>I have regularly used popular frameworks (e.g. Django, Backbone) and both relational and NoSQL databases (Postgres, MySQL, DynamoDB, Elasticsearch, Redis, Cassandra).</p>
  <p>I have experience with full SDLC and am very keen on testing, continuous integration and best practices. I prefer having a diversified suite of unit tests, smoke/integration tests as well as performance tests for critical pieces of the system.</p>
